<h1>Using buttons</h1>

<h3 class="mt-4">The default buttons</h3>
<p>When using buttons on most common pages - the main style to used is outlined below. The key is to consider which action is the next / most important action for the user and the use the primary button for that. The primary button should not be overused as it will loose its impact. As a rule - try and have 2-3x the number of secoundary buttons for each primary button.
</p> 
<p> The primary / call to action button:</p>

<blockquote>
    
    <button class="btn btn-pink">Pink Button</button>

</blockquote>

<pre>
	
	&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-pink&quot;&gt;Pink Button&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>

<p>The secoundary / most commonly used:</p>
<blockquote>
    
    <button class="btn btn-purple">Purple Button</button>

</blockquote>

<pre>
	
	&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-purple&quot;&gt;Purple Button&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>

<p class="mt-4">The green button</p>
<p>In some cases we need a green button for the UI e.g. adding a credit card or accepting certain terms etc.</p> 
<p>How it looks:</p>
<blockquote>
    
    <button class="btn btn-green">Green Green</button>

</blockquote>

<pre>
	
	&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-green&quot;&gt;Green Button&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>

<h3 class="mt-8">The inverse buttons</h3>

<p>Sometimes we need to use the less attention driven button on a background color which is the same color as the button. For these cases we use the inverse buttons. However, we do not have a pink version of this button - only a purple and grey one.</p> 
<p>How they look:</p>
<blockquote class="bg-purple-darker">
    
    <button class="btn btn-purple-inverse">Purple Inverse Button</button>

</blockquote>

<pre>
	
	&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-purple-inverse&quot;&gt;Purple Inverse Buttonn&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>

<blockquote class="bg-grey-light">
    
    <button class="btn btn-grey-inverse">Grey Inverse Button</button>

</blockquote>

<pre>
	
	&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-grey-inverse&quot;&gt;Grey Inverse Buttonn&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>
